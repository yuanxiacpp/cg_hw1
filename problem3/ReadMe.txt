building:
	the vertical line in fourier indicating the left side line of the building, and those lines in the direction from upper left to bottom right indicating the right side of the building. Some of the horizontal fourier indcating the horizontal edges on the building




cloud:
	the edge of the cloud tends to be chaotic. hence we get a very big spot in the center of the fourier.
